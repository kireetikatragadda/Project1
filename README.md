Predicting the heart disease with machine learning

this nootebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and datascience libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

we are going to take the following approach 1.Problem definition 2.Data 3.evaluation 4.Features 5.Modelling 6.Experimentation
